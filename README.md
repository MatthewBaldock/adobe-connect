PHP Client for Adobe Connect's API (tested with v9)
==================================================

At the moment, the client not implement methods for all the Adobe Connect's API actions (You're invited to do it :)),
instead, we just implement those that we usually use in our system.

ToDo
====

- Add unit test.
- Implement more methods.
- Add Documentation.

*Note: We don't have any relation with Adobe.*
